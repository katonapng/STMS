# Spatiotemporal Modeling and Simulation Exercises

### PLEASE NOTE THAT THE DISCRIPTIONS ARE AI GENERATED

This repository contains solutions to a series of exercises focused on spatiotemporal modeling and simulation. Below are descriptions and implementation details for each exercise.

## Exercise 5: Implementing Cell List and Verlet List

### Objective:
Implement and compare the cell list and Verlet list methods for efficiently managing particles in a simulation.

### Description:
- **Cell List:** Partition the simulation space into a grid of cells. Each particle is assigned to a cell, and interactions are only considered within neighboring cells.
- **Verlet List:** Maintain a list of nearby particles for each particle.

### Implementation Details:
1. **Cell List:**
   - Create a grid structure based on the simulation domain.
   - Assign each particle to the corresponding cell.
   - For each particle, consider interactions with particles in the same and neighboring cells.

2. **Verlet List:**
   - For each particle, maintain a list of neighboring particles within a specified cutoff radius.
   - Use the Verlet list to determine potential interactions.

## Exercise 6: Modeling Diffusion with Random Walk (RW) and Particle Strength Exchange (PSE)

### Objective:
Model the diffusion process using Random Walk (RW) and Particle Strength Exchange (PSE) methods.

### Random Walk (RW):

#### Description:
- Simulate particle movement as a series of random steps.

#### Implementation Details:
1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize particles with random positions in a given domain.
   
2. **Movement:**
   - At each time step, move each particle randomly in one of the possible directions.
   
3. **Tracking:**
   - Record the positions of particles over time to analyze the diffusion process using binning.

## Exercise 7: Modeling the Brusselator Reactions with Diffusion using PSE

### Objective:
Simulate the Brusselator reaction-diffusion system using the Particle Strength Exchange (PSE) method.

### Description:
The Brusselator is a theoretical model for a type of autocatalytic reaction. This exercise involves combining reaction kinetics with diffusion to model the spatiotemporal behavior of the system.

### Implementation Details:

#### Reaction Kinetics:
The Brusselator model is governed by the following reaction equations:
- \( A \rightarrow X \)
- \( 2X + Y \rightarrow 3X \)
- \( B + X \rightarrow Y + D \)

These reactions can be expressed as differential equations:
- \( \frac{dX}{dt} = A + X^2Y - (B + 1)X \)
- \( \frac{dY}{dt} = BX - X^2Y \)

#### Diffusion:
Use the Particle Strength Exchange (PSE) method to simulate the diffusion of reactants.

#### Steps:
1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize particle positions randomly within a given domain.
   - Initialize particle concentrations (X and Y) randomly.

2. **Reaction Update:**
   - At each time step, update the concentrations of X and Y based on the reaction kinetics.

3. **Diffusion Update:**
   - Use the PSE method to simulate the diffusion of X and Y.

4. **Combine Steps:**
   - At each time step, perform both reaction and diffusion updates to simulate the complete reaction-diffusion system.


## Exercise 8: Modeling Reaction-Diffusion in the Quorum Sensing Model

### Objective:
Simulate the quorum sensing mechanism using a reaction-diffusion model.

### Description:
Quorum sensing is a process by which bacteria communicate based on their population density. This exercise models the production, diffusion, and sensing of signaling molecules within a bacterial population.

### Implementation Details:

#### Production and Decay:
- **Production:** Bacteria produce signaling molecules at a certain rate.
- **Decay:** Signaling molecules naturally decay over time.

#### Diffusion:
- Use the Particle Strength Exchange (PSE) method to simulate the diffusion of signaling molecules through the medium.

#### Sensing and Response:
- **Sensing:** Bacteria sense the concentration of signaling molecules.
- **Response:** Bacteria change behavior (e.g., increase production of signaling molecules) when the concentration exceeds a threshold.

### Steps:
1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize particle positions randomly within a given domain.
   - Initialize signaling molecule concentrations to zero.

2. **Production and Decay Update:**
   - At each time step, increase the concentration of signaling molecules due to production by bacteria.
   - Decrease the concentration of signaling molecules due to natural decay.

3. **Diffusion Update:**
   - Use the PSE method to simulate the diffusion of signaling molecules.

4. **Sensing and Response Update:**
   - At each time step, check the concentration of signaling molecules at each particle's location.
   - If the concentration exceeds a threshold, modify the behavior of the bacteria (e.g., increase production rate).
